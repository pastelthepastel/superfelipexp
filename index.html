<h1>Super Felipe XP - The Web Demo</h1>

This is a small game made with TurboWarp and then exported to HTML (yes you're playing through an iframe) by Pastel and Felipe. Features Pastel's music (me!!!! :3) and Felipe's art and also his music too. The game was all coded by Pastel, and this simple website too.<br>
I hope you enjoy the game made with free time! If controls aren't working, try to click the game to focus it and not the outer website.<br>
Also, this is a demo, so the game is not finished and is very short.
